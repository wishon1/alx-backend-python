# 0x00-python_variable_annotations

## Goal and Aim

The goal of this repository is to showcase the usage of variable annotations in Python scripts. Variable annotations were introduced in Python 3.6 as a way to provide optional type hints for variables, improving code readability and maintainability.

### Aim

- Demonstrate the benefits of using variable annotations in Python code.
- Provide examples of variable annotations for basic data types, collections, functions, and classes.
- Show how variable annotations can be used to improve code clarity and reliability.
- Serve as a learning resource for developers looking to understand and implement type hints in their Python projects.
